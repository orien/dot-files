This is my current unix development configuration. I'm working on Mac OS X using iTerm2 with the dark
[solarized](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized) color scheme
and Powerline patched fonts. The majority of tools are configured for developing with Ruby in Vim.
